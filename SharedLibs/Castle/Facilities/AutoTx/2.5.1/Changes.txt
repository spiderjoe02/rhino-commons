==========
Both version 2.0 and version 2.1 compile and work well, but version 2.1 is actually compiled
against castle.core.dll which is the binary in the lib folder, as opposed to 
2.0 which is compiled against an updated source code of the core.core project where I had added
.IO as a namespace.

See the documentation for details on usages.

================
Henrik: Going to release version 2.1. Just cloned. The project builds. S.Tx doesn't build. Making it a submodule.


-----
- SERVICES-7 Fixed 
  "Can't explictly rollback transaction using ATM"

== Beta 5 ==

- Fixed bug reported on the Forum (when a
  component was configured using the component's node, no interceptor
  was being attached)

- Refactored to support configuration and attributes. For example

  [Transactional]
  public class MyTransactionalComponent
  {
    [Transaction]
    public virtual void Save()
    {
    }
  }
  
  is equivalent to 
  
  <component 
	id="someid" 
	type="MyTransactionalComponent, MyAssembly"
	isTransactional="true">
  
    <transaction>
      <method name="Save" />
    </transaction>
  
  </component>

  You can also specify the transaction mode and isolation:
  
  <transaction>
    <method name="Save" transactionMode="Requires" isolationLevel="Chaos" />
  </transaction>
